            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello! I'm Mahesh Reddy. They call me a psychopath, a master of manipulation, and a lover of chaos. My life is a twisted journey, driven by a desire for control and a fascination with the dark side of human nature.</p>

            <h2>Stories</h2>
            <h3>The Loan That Turned Sour</h3>
            <p>It started with a simple act of kindness. A friend, in desperate need, asked for a loan. Trusting him, I lent him a substantial amount of money. Months passed, and the repayment never came. Excuses piled up, and soon, he vanished, leaving me betrayed and out of pocket. It wasn't just about the money; it was the trust shattered by someone I considered a friend. The experience taught me a harsh lesson about the true nature of people.</p>
            <h3>Broken Trust</h3>
            <p>In the throes of what I believed was a loving relationship, my girlfriend and I shared everything. Or so I thought. One day, I discovered she had been seeing someone else behind my back for months. The betrayal cut deep, not just because of the infidelity, but because of the lies and deceit. It was a stark reminder that even those closest to you can harbor secrets that can tear your world apart.</p>
            <h3>The Backstabbing Friend</h3>
            <p>We were inseparable, or so I believed. This friend was like a brother to me, until the day he decided to climb the social ladder at my expense. He spread malicious rumors and manipulated situations to turn others against me. By the time I realized what was happening, the damage was done. The betrayal by someone I trusted implicitly left scars that would never fully heal. It was a brutal awakening to the dark side of friendship.</p>
